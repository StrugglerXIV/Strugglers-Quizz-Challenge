# Struggler's Portfolio Challenge

## Description

This one took almost an entire day to make but I'm happy to present my portfolio to all who wish to see it.
I obviously had a lot of fun with this and tried to implement as many cool things as I could within the timeframe.
I do believe I can do much better but this will have to do for a days work.
